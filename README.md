# Disentanglement properties of Style-based Image Generation

*In this project, we apply the StyleSpace analysis on StyleGAN, StyleALAE and StyleFlow architectures to study the effect of the mapping network on the disentanglement properties observed in the latent spaces W and W+, and the Style Space S. Furthermore, we study how these spaces compare to a disentangled space created using an invertible interpretation network from [4]. We compare the image generation quality and disentanglement between these models as well as the manipulation quality between Style Space S and StyleFlow.
